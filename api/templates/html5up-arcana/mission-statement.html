										<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
										<p>"A System to Support Secure Crowdfunding Information Sharing between General Venture Capitalists and Companies Seeking Investment"</p>

<h3 align=center> The goal of this system is to provide a means for potential investors to share their expertise
    so that each can determine the viability of the investment.</h3>
									<p align = center>
                                    One variation of Financial Technology (Fintech) uses crowdfunding combined with crowd intelligence
                                    as a means to provide transparency (information disclosure) into a company’s viability, replacing
                                    traditional Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prospectus. This allows companies and
                                    investors to avoid the extremely high cost of both investing and capital acquisition associated with
                                    traditional investment banking. Investment banks normally identify asymmetric information
                                     and moral
                                    hazards
                                    . <br><br>
                                    Lokahi Fintech Crowdfunding (LFC) brings together small investors and small firms needing venture
                                    capital which would otherwise be excluded from this financial market. Companies seeking venture
                                    capital need a means to disseminate information about their company and its potential growth and
                                    profit in a safe and secure environment. Potential investors need a means to collect, share, and
                                    distribute information about the potential investments in a similar environment. The goal is to develop a
                                    secure system in which companies and investors can work together to share feedback and avoid
                                    asymmetric information and moral hazards. <br><br>
                                    Lokahi Fintech Crowdfunding (version 1) will allow a company (“company user”) seeking capital to create a
                                    report containing information about their business plan and current project(s). This report will be made up
                                    of some standard information fields and one or more files. The information and files will be uploaded using
                                    a web application where they will be stored securely on a server.<br><br>
                                    A company user can indicate that a report is private. This means that permission to view all information
                                    stored in a private report can be granted by the company user to particular users or to a group of users,
                                    and the report will not be visible to others. <br><br>
                                    An “investor user” can add files to a report that can contain information relevant to the subject company
                                    including data on the general business cycle, sector, industry along with particulars regarding the
                                    company’s executives. <br><br>
                                    Independently of its public/private status, files attached to a report can optionally be marked as encrypted
                                    when they are uploaded to the server. The file must be encrypted before it is uploaded to the web
                                    application. <br><br>
                                    A user can leave a private message for a specific user. A user will have the ability to see a list of
                                    messages left for him or her, and be able to delete a message. Private messages will be encrypted, and
                                    the recipient can choose to decrypt it and then read it.<br> <br>
                                    A stand-alone program (i.e. one that runs on a user's local machine) must be created to download and
                                    decrypt files in a report that are encrypted. This stand-alone program must communicate with the webapplication
                                    to: list reports that are visible to that user; allow the user to choose a report, and then download
                                    a file in that report and decrypt it. The stand-alone program should also be able to encrypt a file that a user
                                    chooses for later uploading of encrypted files.<br> <br>
                                    Any person can create an account that allows them to become a user by registering with the system.
                                    There will be at least one user with the role of site-manager. Site-managers can give other users sitemanager
                                    privilege. They can suspend and un-suspend a user’s account. They can see all reports (even
                                    the private ones). They can update and delete reports
                                    </p>
